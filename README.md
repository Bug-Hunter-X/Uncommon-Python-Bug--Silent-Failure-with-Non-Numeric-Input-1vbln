This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a Python function designed to calculate the average of a list of numbers.  The function correctly handles empty lists but fails silently if the input contains non-numeric data. This can lead to unexpected results or runtime errors that are difficult to trace.  The `bug.py` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected and more robust version.
